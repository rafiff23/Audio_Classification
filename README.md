# Data Classification Using NN and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

# Background

In this era, types of data are becoming more varied. Demand for processing raw voice data is increasing due to increased demand for sentiment analysis for improving services. This analysis can be used for example at customer services, finding music title, or improving sales through call centers. 

From these problems we will use audio data for creating machine learning model and one of the most popular and good method for working with unstructured data is using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

This material aims to provide an understanding for the workshop participants to classify audio data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). One Instructor and two Teaching Assistants will help participants troubleshoot or help with any difficulties encountered.

# Neural Network

A neural network, or artificial neural network (ANN), is a machine learning method inspired by how the human brain transmits information through the nervous system (biological neural network). There are two main components of a neural network: architecture and the learning process.

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used architectures for processing image data. However, as mentioned earlier, the processed audio data we have resembles image-like structures. This makes CNNs highly relevant for use in this context.  

## **Convolution Concepts**  
In the previous model, we learned how to classify song genres into different categories. However, there are some challenges:  

- When using dense layers, the number of parameters to be trained is very large.  
- The data used often contains irrelevant information, which does not improve the model but rather increases training time.

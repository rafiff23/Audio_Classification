# Data Classification Using NN and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

# Background

In this era, types of data are becoming more varied. Demand for processing raw voice data is increasing due to increased demand for sentiment analysis for improving services. This analysis can be used for example at customer services, finding music title, or improving sales through call centers. 

From these problems we will use audio data for creating machine learning model and one of the most popular and good method for working with unstructured data is using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

This material aims to provide an understanding for the workshop participants to classify audio data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). One Instructor and two Teaching Assistants will help participants troubleshoot or help with any difficulties encountered.

# Neural Network

A neural network, or artificial neural network (ANN), is a machine learning method inspired by how the human brain transmits information through the nervous system (biological neural network). There are two main components of a neural network: architecture and the learning process.

## Neural Network Architecture

The human nervous system consists of nerve cells called neurons, which are numerous and interconnected to form a network. Every stimulus/input from the environment is received by sensory organs as signals and then transmitted through neurons from one nerve cell to another.

This neural system architecture is what inspired the development of neural network models.
